# run_nmr.R
#
# Called by comparison.jl / single_site.jl (via pipeline.jl) as:
#   Rscript run_nmr.R <outdir>
#
# Reads four CSV files written by Julia:
#   nmr_params.csv    — scalar model parameters
#   nmr_forcing.csv   — daily forcing from the chosen weather source (already
#                        lapse/RH/wind corrected by MicroclimateMapper.jl —
#                        weather-source-agnostic from here on)
#   nmr_soil.csv      — 10-node thermal soil properties
#   nmr_soil19.csv    — 19-node soil moisture properties
#   nmr_initial.csv   — initial soil T and SM at 10 NMR nodes
#
# Calls NicheMapR::microclimate() directly (the Fortran solver) with Julia's
# identical forcing, bypassing micro_usa's internal OPeNDAP fetch.
#
# Writes to outdir:
#   metout.csv, soil.csv, soilmoist.csv, sunsnow.csv
#   nmr_timing.csv  — solver elapsed time (seconds)
